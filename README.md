# Julia Adventures

Spending summer 2021 learning a new programming language: Julia. 

Inspired by this [post](https://tobydriscoll.net/blog/matlab-vs.-julia-vs.-python/). 

Learning content from [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) and [Linear and Dynamical Systems](http://ee263.stanford.edu/).
