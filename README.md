# Julia Adventures

Spending summer 2021 learning a new programming language: Julia. 

Inspired by this [post](https://tobydriscoll.net/blog/matlab-vs.-julia-vs.-python/). 

Learning content from [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) and [Linear and Dynamical Systems](http://ee263.stanford.edu/).

## Two Class Distributions

An [interactive tool](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.14.5/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252FBscout2011%252Fjulia_adventures%252Fmain%252Fdistributions.jl) for visualizing classification.

## Thoughts

Opening Julia is slow. I feel like I'm entering a large presidential palace. Lots of grand architecture, and slow procession. I am beginning to understand the "fast" some people refer to, and what the promise of uncompromising `for-loops` could become. But I don't see the killer app behind why it's becomming the new-new thing. One exciting feature, referred to as *multiple-dispatch*, introduces a new implmentation of a 40 year old technology, and something that R, Python, and C++ perform without much fanfare. Except in dreaded Computer Science object-oriented programming college courses. Pluto is another rehash of R Notebooks (even though it's a programming language for statisticians, R birthed some very innovative tools for rapid prototyping and visualization). For my toy problems, I haven't found a Julia's killer technique. Maybe if I get into developing custom image processing tools, or modeling large dynamic networks, I will develop this skill further.
