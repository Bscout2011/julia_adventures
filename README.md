# Julia Adventures

Spending summer 2021 learning a new programming language: Julia. 

Inspired by this [post](https://tobydriscoll.net/blog/matlab-vs.-julia-vs.-python/). 

Learning content from [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) and [Linear and Dynamical Systems](http://ee263.stanford.edu/).

## Two Class Distributions

An [interactive tool](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.14.5/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252FBscout2011%252Fjulia_adventures%252Fmain%252Fdistributions.jl) for visualizing classification.
